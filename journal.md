I am still brainstorming ideas for the class project. One of the main leads is creating a model for EV sales - related to the abstract I submitted for my application. Here, I would theoretically use some methods such as matrix completion and time-series prediction on features such as price, location, specs, subsidy eligibility in the location/time, etc. to predict the expected sales in a location/time combination. 

Again, most of my time will be spent collecting data if I were to go through with this project idea. I mentioned some great sources in the application and I plan to continue searching for usable data to stand-in for features this week.
