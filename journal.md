I am still brainstorming ideas for the class project. One of the main leads is creating a model for EV sales - related to the abstract I submitted for my application. Here, I would theoretically use some methods such as matrix completion and time-series prediction on features such as price, location, specs, subsidy eligibility in the location/time, etc. to predict the expected sales in a location/time combination. 

Again, most of my time will be spent collecting data if I were to go through with this project idea. I mentioned some great sources in the application and I plan to continue searching for usable data to stand-in for features this week.

Going through a subject change. Details regarding this change sent over email (shown below):
{I have decided to change my project's subject. Over the last few weeks I have been trying to find data for state-wise EV sales data, EV model specs, state-wise subsidies, etc. and overall all the data is either second-hand, shady or inaccurate. To not waste more time on this, I think I will just leave out the EV subject since I feel that the EV subject itself just doesn't have dependable data that I can access.
The subject I now am gravitating toward:
Using topographic and structure data in the US to define best placements for wind-farms.
While I was looking into infrastructure information for EV car chargers, I ran across the "Optimization of train routes based on neuro-fuzzy modeling" paper below which uses constraint based methods for ranking train routes. This led me to look into wind-farm placement work given the sudden rise of wind-farms across the US and the world. Then I found some other statistical approaches for determining wind-farm locations using GIS data (that I will look over this week). After understanding these statistical approaches, I want to try to extend the use of methods in EV car charger locations (found in "Review of Electric Vehicle Charging Station Location Planning") to wind farm locations.
Possible data:
This website from the USGS contains data for topography and structure information for the US. https://apps.nationalmap.gov/downloader/#/}

This week I plan to look over the past work in GIS-based wind-farm placements.
